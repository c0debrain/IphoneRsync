I use this scrypt to backup my stupid Apple Iphone
on my Linux Box, using ssh + rsync.

I had to jailbreak my Iphone, because Apple doesn't
allow you to manage as you want _YOUR_ device. There's
always a Microsoft on the market. Today it's the Apple
turn.

Anyway, the script is really easy. Jailbreak your Iphone
and install openssh and rsync. After that, just edit the
script and change your variables.

Customization is easy, because this script is stupid.
